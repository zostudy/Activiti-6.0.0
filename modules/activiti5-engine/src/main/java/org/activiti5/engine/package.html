    Public API of the Activiti engine.<br/><br/>
    Typical usage of the API starts by the creation of a {@link org.activiti5.engine.ProcessEngineConfiguration}
    (typically based on a configuration file), from which a {@link org.activiti5.engine.ProcessEngine} can be obtained.<br/><br/>
    Through the services obtained from such a {@link org.activiti5.engine.ProcessEngine}, BPM and workflow operation 
    can be executed:<br/><br/>
